# Policy-Reading-Document-PDF-chatting-tool
This project is an AI-powered PDF chatbot that transforms how you interact with documents. Instead of manually searching through lengthy PDFs, you can simply upload any document—like contracts, policies, research papers, or manuals—and ask questions in plain English. Powered by Google Gemini 2.0 Flash and Langchain, the chatbot understands your queries, contextually analyzes the PDF, and provides detailed, logical answers extracted directly from the content.

Practical benefits:

Instantly extract key clauses, terms, or red flags from contracts and legal agreements, helping you make informed decisions without missing important details.

Summarize and clarify academic papers, user manuals, or business documents for faster comprehension.

Enhance productivity by automating information retrieval and making dense text accessible through conversational AI.

The app is built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use web experience. Perfect for anyone who regularly deals with complex documents and wants accurate, reliable answers without the hassle of manual searching. Just upload, ask, and know!
